# Coding Concepts 

## Data Types

- Primitive data types 
    - Python : int, float, str, and bool
- User defined data types

### Data Structures

**Definition**: a particular way of storying and organizing data in order to be used efficiently

1) *Linear data structures* - elements are accessed in sequential order, however the data does not need to be stored sequentially

    Examples:

    - Linked Lists
    - Stacks
    - Queues

2) *Non-linear data structures* - element are stored and accesssed in non-linear order

    Examples:

    - Trees
    - Graphs
